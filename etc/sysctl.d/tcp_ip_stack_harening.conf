### TCP SYN cookie protection (default)
### helps protect against SYN flood attacks
### only kicks in when net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog is reached
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

### protect against tcp time-wait assassination hazards
### drop RST packets for sockets in the time-wait state
### (not widely supported outside of linux, but conforms to RFC)
net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337 = 1

### tcp timestamps
### + protect against wrapping sequence numbers (at gigabit speeds)
### + round trip time calculation implemented in TCP
### - causes extra overhead and allows uptime detection by scanners like nmap
### enable @ gigabit speeds
net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0
#net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 1

### source address verification (sanity checking)
### helps protect against spoofing attacks
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1

### disable ALL packet forwarding (not a router, disable it) (default)
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

### log martian packets
net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1

### ignore echo broadcast requests to prevent being part of smurf attacks (default)
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1

### optionally, ignore all echo requests
### this is NOT recommended, as it ignores echo requests on localhost as well
##net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1
#
### ignore bogus icmp errors (default)
net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1

### IP source routing (insecure, disable it) (default)
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0

### send redirects (not a router, disable it)
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0

### ICMP routing redirects (only secure)
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
##net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects = 1 (default)
